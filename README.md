========

We hope to make this repo a source for analysis scripts. For now, this will be used to analyze iEEG data. 
For example, one script can be used to extract certain bandpass power from the data, and transform the data into standardize values (z-score).

Can also be used to analyze certain tasks, such as the Zoolander task and continuous data sets.
